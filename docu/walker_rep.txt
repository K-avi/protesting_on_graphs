Walkers are stored in a plain array. 

To acces this array we will use a table containing references to the walkers. 
The Table is indexed by node key. 

This allows to retrieve every Walker at a specific node in O(a) where a is the number of walker in a certain node. 

The table stores an array of walker reference at each entry. 
This allows us to "remove" and "add" walkers in O(1) 

and to get a walker in O(a) where a is the number of walker at a specific node (very small)
