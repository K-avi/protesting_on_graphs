it contains a size field to keep track of the number of entries in it 

a GraphTableEntry pointer field containing the graph's entry (see docu of GraphTableEntry)

a LineArray pointer field where the adjacency lists of the graph are stored (see docu of LineAray)

a WalkerArray pointer field containing the walkers present in the graph
(see docu of WalkerArray)

a WalkerCurNext field to keep track of the position of the walkers (see docu of WalkerCurNext)

a cur_gen field which is an integer used to keep track of the number of iterations since
