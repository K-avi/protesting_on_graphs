Writing the walker storage structure; it's gonna be a beeg array w all of em and the table 
will contain references to that array that I'll move around in the table at each generation 

this allows for movement of a Walker from a node to a node in ~O(1)

the actual graphs I'll use will be retrieved from OSM and pretreated in python with OSMnx 
(I'll write a script to do that at some point)         

 
also will have to do clean error reporting 

done : 
    - graphs are kinda implemented :)
        - I can add stuf to them 
        - I can print them :) (I can't load them from a file yet though)

        - I can also load them let's go 
    
    - script can load a city into a networkx graph thingy (easy part) 

    - walker structure pretty much done (testing pending though)



pending : 
    
    - walker structure : 
        - test the thing ffs 
    
    - rule / tactics structure : 
        - good question 
    
    - figure out the way to implement movement : 
        - add iteration field to line arr and walkers; if don't match don't take into account 
        - add curflux / netflux field to line arr , at the start of iteration set curflux to nextflux 
          and reset nextflux 

    - make the pyhton script to retrieve / format / write real graphs from the real world
      (god have mercy on me) 

        - do a function to handle the whole discretisation of the graph w a custom step 
          (scary part)
        - then do a function to dump it in the custom csv format (less scary but prolly hard part)


change the line arr to contain an union of key/pointer; 
once the arrays are fully initialised -> change keys into reference to primary array 
-> this allows to go through the graph fast 

TEST THE GODDAMN TABLE FFS
