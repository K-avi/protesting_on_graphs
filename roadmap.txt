redesign of code structure count : 5 
I didn't rewrite the data analysis mind you. However it WAS done so it DOES count

the done section writes every step I did ; some of them are obsolete (for example I changed 
implem of graphs multiple times) but it's a good way to track my progress

done : 

    - graphs are kinda implemented
        - I can add stuf to them 
        - I can print them (I can't load them from a file yet though)

        - I can also load them let's go 
    
    - script can load a city into a networkx graph thingy (easy part) 

    - walker structure pretty much done 

    - apparently I wrote a tactics structure I didn't even remember it 

    - rewrote the graph implem in the GraphTable structure 

    - wrote the table manip fn ; haven't tested them yet

    - graph table fully implmented 

    - deleted deprecated stuff

    - implemented some of the movement ; tested it 

    - finished the python script ( written the discretisation function and functions to read / 
      write custom CSVs ) nb : the loadCSV function doesn't care for flux atm but it will at some
      point 

    - test the new wte structure 
    - test the updated graph_table functions 

    - movement mostly done ; problem with the update of flux for some 
      reason (not anymore)

    -fixed the flux

    - do some proper testing of simulations (kinda)

    - write the tactics stuff (tested ) (now it is)

    - write propper error reporting 

    - put error reporting at the right place 

    - re implement tactics

    - test tactics (kind of done )

    - write the actual main n maybe do a script to call stuff in bash or smtg 
      ( finished ; tested )
    
    - find out how to parse tactics  (tested yet )

    - removed some of the unnecessary elements from the structure ; 
      watch out for potential bugs IG

    - finish docu (docu of usage is still pending bc main isn't done yet )

    - write a wrapper around trace dump

    - tested main 

    - test tactics parsing

    - write the different rules 

    - format output 

    - separate mutable / immutable fields of walkers (necessary to create relevant trace)
      I actually just replaced the posref inside the walker to an uint32 representing 
      the index so it should work now 
    
    - remove more elements from structures to gain space (I might be able to remove more 
      but I'm not sure what I could do tbh)
    
    - write the whole load trace python script

    - implemented the coefficient based attraction rule

    - make the movement choice a meta tactic 

    - make sure that the program behaves well when not given optionnal args

    - scale walker num like opt args

    - fix the args handling (I think)

    - heavy perftest : tested  time complexity of different rules ; 
      results were predictible ; 
      from slowest to fastest : 

      attco 
      align 
      attra 
      rand
      sleep 

    - tested multi threading ; thread management is slower than running the actual 
      simulation on small scale (lol)
      might retest w a bigger graph I dunno 
    
    - found out something really weird : the space complexity DID NOT 
      affect the number of nodes where I get out of the cache so I'm not sure what 
      causes me to break in perftest. I'm really confused

    - perftest another 20000walker * 1000 it simul cuz the last result was fucked up 
      done; results are what were expected but kinda disapointing- redo the flux correctly ; current flux thing is bad 
    
    - wrote + tested most of the dt analysis functions ; haven't tested 
      the nb nodes visited by walkers yet 
    
    - wrote python script to start 1 simulation and generate it's trace 

    - change the way dumping works program should dump w smtg like 
      "-d tname" and then create tname_flux tname_curnum , ...
    
    -  fix the number of threads used for the program (not tested )

    - figure out proper way to parse walking_on_graphs rules 
      they can be given as a single beeg string to bash and it will then 
      be read correctly by the C program (cool)
    
    - implement rule parsing - redo the flux correctly ; current flux thing is bad 

    - finish the shell / python wrapper for the program 
      wire up the different sections of the prgm smtg like : 
      python retriever -> C simulation -> python trace loader -> python dt analysis 
                        (possibility to run the simulation a bunch of times to get avg of simul)
    - relabel the first 200 runs of the db (shite)
    - start simulations in batch on multiple CPUs (the idea is that 1 simulation is too fast to 
      benefit of multithread so just start a bunch of them on a bunch of threads)
    
    - implemented / tested a script to start simulations w random parameters to gener- redo the flux correctly ; current flux thing is bad 

    - optimize the python stuff  ( call for help)

    - dt analysis was heavily optimized by https://github.com/Pacidus

    - data analysis is : done (yes. yes. yes.)

    - possibility to start simulation w an array of walkers  ; this allows to "restart" a simul 
      -d also dumps final flux state so by loading the _hrend and _wkend from a previous dump 
      you can basically restart a simul w new parameters (nice stuff)
    
    - 1/n coeff to not move (ur coeff to move i 1/n where n is the number of walkers  
      currently at your position)
    
    - test the move coeff thingy

    - disable debug in C and make stuff static cuz cleaner n so on 

    - density of groups -> done 

    - number of occupied nodes ->  done 

    - option to dump flux from a certain it onward  - redo the flux correctly ; current flux thing is bad 

    - function to generate db ( see meeting notes )

    - generate db function 

    - propulsion rule written (parsing + actual rule ) 

    - test propulsion 

    - write a clean plot script  "clean" 

        
    - the flux thing I forgot what it was supposed to be exactly :
      during the last 10 iteratiosn ; the sum of flux from a to b 
      minus the sum of flux from b to a 
      then sum all of that ; divide it by the nb of walkers 
      times the nb of iteration the flux has been dumped for 

    - write the mean simul thing for the flux value  ( might need more testing )

    - launch db generation on server if everything is ok 

    - write a clean dt analysis script (will have to improve it at some point)

     - do the query / plot thingy for db (not tested)

    - did docu ; there's prolly a bunch of typos in it that I'll have to fix at some point

    - redo the flux correctly ; current flux thing is bad 

    - relabel the first 200 runs of the db (shite)

    - corrected typos in docu
    
    - db generated 

    - do the measures plot for bigisim w the new rules  

    - do the script to retrieve the mean flux and the last "density" of group and 
        plot them for every sim
    
    - write a db gen variant just to recalculate the flux mean with the updated version
	
    - corrected the flux for paris ; generated bases for hong kong , lyon , manhattan

    - started simul for 100*100 discretised lattice  
      (wait until one of the simuls is done before launching)

    - add the percentile of group over nb nodes to traces

    - add rand to plot 
          plot good sims instead of noisy 
    
    - add a turn of "noise" during a run ; doesn't do shit; should prolly add 50~100 turns of propu to spread groups 

    - run simuls with slow down rule (on paris)

    - implement movement together (Paris)

    - did branch to stop simul when a certain group size is reached 

    - implement a coefficient based alignement 

    - create a graph from a lattice where I delete 30% of nodes , take 
        the big connected componnent and then discretise it
    
    -  run align on small word (generate it, filter it , discretise it )  

    - collective randwalk w 3 then 2 times more wk than nodes 
        then 1.5 then 1 then then 0.8 - 0.2 step of 0.2 and 0.1

        should converge to around the same nb of gp unless too few guys
    
    - redo scaterplot (separate noisy not noisy)

      - add support for slow and collective on scatterplot
      
      - if majority is align or smtg add different point shape 
      (triangle align , square attra etc)
      - change color when scatterplot of multiple bases     

      - the return of the fn should be : 

          - array of : 
              - array containing :
                [0] points that are noisy 
                [1] other points 
                
                they are both structured the same : 
                  majority of rand -> index 0 
                              zttra -> 1 
                              attco -> 2 
                              align -> 3 
                              propu -> 4 
                              no majority -> 5
