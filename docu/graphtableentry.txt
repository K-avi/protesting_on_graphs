a GraphTableEntry stores the information needed to store the adjacency list of a node in the graph. 

in order to do so , it stores the reference to the first neighbor of the node in
the array of adjacency lists (cf LineAray docu) as well as the number of neighbors of the node
this makes it possible to know when the adjacency list of the entry stops.
