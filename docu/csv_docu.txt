The CSV format used to write / read graphs will be as follows :

the first line of the csv contains the number of nodes / lines in the graph

the next lines represent the adjacency lists of the nodes 

the fields are separated by a comma. Inside the line field , 
the lines are separated by a colon. 

node_index,number_of_lines,line1:flux1;line2:flux2...lineN:fluxN

this representation allows to store a graph with custom flux (usefull to
dump a trace from a certain generation)
