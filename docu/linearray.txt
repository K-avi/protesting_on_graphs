the LineAray is the array storing relevant information of the lines of a graph.

the size / cur_in fields keep track of the max number of elements / current number 
of elements in the LineAray.

the Line * array field is the main array of the structure. It contains the 
adjacency lists of every node in the graph stored as an array. This means that they are 
stored at the same place in memory. 
At the moment, a line only stores the index of the node it represents. It used to store a reference 
to this node in the GraphTableEntry structure as well but it isn't necessary and removing 
it allows for smaller space complexity (even though it means doing an substraction to retrieve the 
Entry it corresponds to)

the LineAray also stores two integer arrays corresponding to the flux at a certain line.
During the runtime, the lookup of the flux in the line l at the iteration i is retrieved from the 
cur_flux array. 
The flux that will be used at the iteration i+1 is calculated in the next_flux array. 

The way the flux is stored is that the flux corresponding to the line represented at 
the index l of the Line * array is stored at cur_flux[l]
