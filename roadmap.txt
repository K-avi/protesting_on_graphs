currently going over global skeleton of project and implementing the basic graph structure.
will try to implement a basic "append nodes" function to the graph to test writing nodes


my goal will be to be able to write / load formatted csv files w this function

the graph implem is very minimalist so it might be tricky to implement

once I'm done w this function I'll do a small test graph and will then move on to the basics of the walkers. 


the actual graphs I'll use will be retrieved from OSM and pretreated in python with OSMnx 
(I'll write a script to do that at some point)
