a graph is represented by a simple implementation of an adjacency list.

The idea of it is that one array stores the nodes of the graph , the degree of said nodes and the index (or reference I'm not sure 
yet) of their first neighboor in an array.
In a second array we store, in order every nodes b in a line (a, b ). A way to see it is that we store the adjacency 
lists directly one after the other in an array.
