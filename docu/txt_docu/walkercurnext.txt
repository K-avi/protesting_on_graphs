the WalkerCurNext is a simple wrapper around two arrays of walker of the 
same size.

the size field of the structure is the number of elements in the arrays.

the arrays store the number of walker in a node of the graph. To retrieve the number 
of walker currently occupying a node n in the graph you have to 

check the nth index of the cur_num array. (cur_num[n])

to calculate the number of walkers in a node n at the iteration i+1 you increment 
the next_num array.
