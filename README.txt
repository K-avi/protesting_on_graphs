this is the propulsion branch ; a subbranch of the anonymous walkers branch 
which will implement the "propulsion" rule. 
I don't like the way I'll implement this rule. 
I think it's ugly; weird looking and that it kinda sucks. 
So I will never merge it with the anonymous walkers 
or at least I don't plan to 

This repo contains the code written during my internship at the Lip6 lab. 

The goals of my internship are: 

- implement an efficient Simulation of walkers on a graph
- write data analysis of this simulation 
- maybe do other fun things (generating a small db of simulations ? ) 

the source code for the simulation is written in C and is stored in the src directory
the source code for the data analysis is stored in the graph_treatment repository 
the python scripts in graph_treatment have been optimized and cleaned up by
