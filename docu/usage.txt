to use the program ; you must pass it an input file for it to load a graph from. 

You must then pass a integer representing the number of iterations and an integer 
representing a number of walker 

the other arguments are not necessary and are options and tactics arguments. 

the options supported are -h to print out help and return and -d to dump the graph at each iteration. 

the rules arguments are passed as formatted string : 

RuleName:coeff 

the coeffs passed can be any floating point number as it will be renormalized before
running the simulation

the rules currently supported are : 
rand (random movement) 
align ( alignement rule)
attra (attraction rule)
sleep (doesn't do anything) deprecated 
attco (attraction coeff rule)


example of a string of rule argument : 

attra:3 align:2 rand:1

the program will load this and make it so there's ~16% of chances that a walker will sleep 
~33% of chances that it will align and ~50% of chances it will be attracted.
(the numbers are casted as integers so the probabilities aren't exact)
