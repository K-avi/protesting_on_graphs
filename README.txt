This repo contains the code written during my internship at the Lip6 lab. 

The goals of my internship are: 

- implement an efficient Simulation of protesters on a graph
- write data analysis of this simulation 
- maybe do other fun things (generating a small db of simulations ? ) 

the source code for the simulation is written in C and is stored in the src directory
the source code for the data analysis is stored in the graph_treatment repository 
the python scripts in graph_treatment have been optimized and cleaned up by
