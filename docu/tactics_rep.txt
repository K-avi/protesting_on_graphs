the Tactics are stored in the s_tactics structure .

it is currently implemented as a dynamic array but will be changed to a static one soon.

the size/ capa fields stores it's current size and max size.

the Rule * rule_arr is the actual array containing the rules present in a tactic.

an entry in the array contains a coeff represented as an 8 bit integer that is calculated by 
flooring the numbers given as argument to the program and a function pointer to the rule associated 
with this coeff. When calculating the movement of a Walker , a random number is generated and 
the rule corresponding to this number is used to determine the node a walker will go to.
