the graph_treatment directory contains the scripts
to do data analysis with the simulation. 

the scripts than can be used from the command line are :

- autorun_simul.py : when given correct parameters (see usage of the script) 
will run simulations and create relevant data analysis for this simulation 

- create_dt.py : infinitely runs and analyses simulations with randomized parameters     
                 will be used if (when) I'll create a small db of simulations

the other scripts are dependencies or small help script that shouldn't be used
(ie : plot_compare.py)
