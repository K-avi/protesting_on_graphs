            <h2><u>I: Introduction</u></h2>
            <p>
            Walking on graphs is a program used to simulate the movement 
            of "Walker" like entities on small to medium sized 
            graphs (the biggest graph the program can theoretically load has 4.3*10e9 nodes,
            lines and walkers but I don't recommend loading something that big).
            The graphs used during the project had sizes varying from a few thousands to 
            ~3*10e6 nodes.<br/>
            Simulation are launched by passing the path to a graph file, a coefficient of walkers 
            (the number of walkers is proportionnal to the number of nodes), and a number of 
            iterations of the simulation (how many times will each walker move). 
            Every other argument (rule arguments, trace argument , ...) is optionnal.

            <p>
                Graphs are represented with adjacency lists in the program
                these adjacency lists (as well as other stuff) are stored in the 
                GraphTable structure of the C code.
                it contains a size field to keep track of the number of entries in it 
                a <a href=#p55>GraphTableEntry</a> pointer field containing the graph's entry
                a <a href=#p53>LineArray</a> pointer field where the adjacency lists of the graph are stored
                a <a href=#p3>WalkerArray</a> pointer field containing the walkers present in the graph
                a <a href=#p54>WalkerCurNext</a> field to keep track of the position of the walkers
                a cur_gen field which is an integer used to keep track of the number of iterations since 
                the beginning of a simulation
            </p>

            <h2><u>III: What are walkers? (spoiler: 32bits ints)</u></h2>
            <p>
                Walkers are pretty simple. Trivial even. They're represented by their 
                current position stored on a 32bit unsigned integer 
                and (if the propulsion is active) another 32bit integer 
                representing their previous position and...that's it. 
                They're very very basic because the different rules used
                to calculate their movement only rely on their neighbor nodes 
                (or their previous position in the case of the propulsion rule)
                The walkers are stored in the WalkerArray, a simple wrapper around the C 
                array that contains a size field , an array of "Walkers" and an array containing 
                the previous position of the walkers.<br/>
                The "id" of the walkers doesn't have to be "stored". Since they are stored in an 
                array you can already identify them with their index when moving them around.

                        to call the program you must pass it: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>the Path to a custom CSV file representing a graph</li>
                            <li>the proportion of walkers compared to the number of nodes (1 is as many walkers as nodes 0.5 twice as less walkers than nodes,...)</li>
                            <li>the number of iterations</li>
                        </ul>
                        every other argument is optionnal however, you will want to customize the behavior of walkers. In order to do so you can pass rules 
                        to the program.<br/>
                        Every rule (except mcrowd MUST be passed with a coefficient)

                        every rule (except for) mprop MUST be passed with a coefficient. The syntax to parse a 
                        rule is : "rule:COEFF" where coeff is a floating point number. <br/>
                        The mcrowd, mconst and mcrowd rules are mutually exclusive and independant from the other rules. 
                        If multiple "mrules" are passed only the last one will be used by the simulation. 
                        They also are independant of the other rules.<br/>
                        When passing normal rules their coefficients will be normalised. This allows for more flexibility with arguments. 
                        for example if you pass "rand:1 align:3" , "rand:0.1 align:0.3", "rand:100 align:300" you can expect the same results. <br/>
                        The "mrules" are NOT normalised. The mconst rule takes a floating point number between 0 and 1 whith 0 meaning 
                        walker will always move and one meaning they'll never move.

                    <p>
                        walking on graphs has a custom error system. When catching an error the program will print error traces 
                        allowing to understand which function calls caused the simulation to fail. These error are not the clearest
                        but I think they're better than random segfaults (and they make the program easier to debug). 
                        The error flags are stored in an enum in the <a href="../../src/common.h">src/common.h file</a>. 
                        The function to print error is stored in <a href="../../src/misc.c">src/misc.c</a> , feel free to check them out 
                        if you want more info on errors.

                    <p>
                        The CSV format used to write / read graphs is as follows :<br/>
                        the first line of the csv contains the number of nodes / lines in the graph<br/>
                        the next lines represent the adjacency lists of the nodes <br/>
                        the fields are separated by a comma. Inside the line field,<br/> 
                        the lines are separated by a colon.<br/>
                        node_index,number_of_lines,line1:flux1;line2:flux2...lineN:fluxN<br/>
                        this representation allows to store a graph with custom flux<br/> (useful to
                        dump/load a trace from a certain generation)

                    <p>
                        The LineAray is the array storing relevant information of the lines of a graph.<br/>
                        the 'size'/'cur_in' fields keep track of the max number of elements / current number 
                        of elements in the LineAray. They are stored on 32bits unsigned integers<br/>
                        
                        the 'Line * array' field is the main array of the structure. It contains the 
                        adjacency lists of every node in the graph stored as an array. This means that they are 
                        stored at the same place in memory which gives the program better performance (less cache misses amongst 
                        other things )<br/>
                        At the moment, a line only stores the index of the node it represents this information
                        is enough to explore the adjacency lists and know which nodes are connected.<br/>
                        
                        The LineAray also stores two integer arrays corresponding to the flux at a certain line.
                        During the runtime, the lookup of the flux in the line l at the iteration i is retrieved from the 
                        cur_flux array. <br/>
                        The flux that will be used at the iteration i+1 is calculated in the next_flux array. 
                        I use these two arrays because they make it possible to move every walker at the "same time". 
                        ie: every walker has access to the same informations when they move.<br/> 
                        It also makes it possible 
                        to "prepare the next iteration" in O(1) since I just need to swap the two arrays and flush the 
                        new "next array".
                        <br/>
                        The way the flux is stored is that the flux corresponding to the line represented at 
                        the index l of the Line * array is stored at cur_flux[l]

                    <p>
                        the WalkerCurNext is a simple wrapper around two arrays of 32bits unsigned integer of the 
                        same size (with the same number of elements)
                        <br/>
                        the 'size' field of the structure is the number of elements in the arrays.
                        <br/>
                        the arrays store the number of walker in a node of the graph. To retrieve the number 
                        of <br/>
                        to calculate the number of walkers in a node n at the iteration i+1 you increment 
                        the next_num array.<br/>
                        Using two arrays allows to swap the two arrays like I do with the LineArray 
                        to prepare an iteration in O(1).

                        a GraphTableEntry stores the information needed to store the adjacency 
                        list of a node in the graph. 
                        in order to do so , it stores the reference to the first neighbor of the
                        node in
                        the array of adjacency lists (cf LineAray docu) as well as the number of
                        neighbors of the node
                        this makes it possible to know when the adjacency list of the entry stops.

                        When running fairly big simulations on fairly big graphs , 
                        producing a trace without it taking a while to be generated 
                        can be an issue.<br/> 
                        The solution used in the program to fix this issue is to heavily rely on dumping 
                        the binary arrays of the graphs.

                        integers on each line , corresponding to the lines (edges).<br/>
                        Every other files contain binary data. They can be loaded in python with the numpy fromfile function.<br/>
