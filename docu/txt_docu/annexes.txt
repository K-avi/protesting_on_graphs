the annexes directory contains secondary parts of the project.

the subdirs in annexes are:

-  archives : contains various tar.gz archives storing
              data analysis results, perftests plots and old 
              binaries

- infinite simul : where I ran various analysis / simulation scripts and that 
                   I'll use if (when) I will generate a database of simulations

- perftest : where the actual perftest scripts are stored
